RISC-V-BASED-MYTH Workshop Report

Overview 

The RISC-V based MYTH (Microprocessor for You in Thirty Hours) workshop, organized by VSD and Redwood EDA, is a comprehensive five-day program designed to provide participants with a hands-on introduction to the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and microprocessor design. This workshop, attended by Ahtesham Ahmed, an 8th-grade student, covers the journey from software to hardware, guiding participants through C programming, assembly, digital logic, and the design of a pipelined RISC-V CPU. The following report summarizes the key learnings, labs, and outcomes of the workshop, as documented in the GitHub repository RISCV_MYTH. Workshop Structure The workshop is divided into five days, each focusing on a specific aspect of RISC-V architecture and microprocessor design. Participants progress from foundational concepts to advanced topics, with practical labs reinforcing theoretical knowledge. Below is a detailed breakdown of each dayâ€™s content and activities.

Day 1: Introduction to RISC-V ISA and GNU Compiler Toolchain Focus: Understanding the RISC-V ISA, binary number systems, and the GNU compiler toolchain.

Key Concepts:

RISC-V ISA: An open-source instruction set architecture that provides a modular and extensible framework for processor design, applicable in embedded systems and high-performance computing. Binary Number System: Introduction to binary numbers (0s and 1s), bits, bytes, words, and doublewords. The number of possible combinations for an n-bit binary number is calculated as (2^n). Signed and Unsigned Numbers: Unsigned numbers represent non-negative integers, while signed numbers use the most significant bit (MSB) to indicate positivity (0) or negativity (1). GNU Compiler Toolchain: Tools like GCC and Spike simulator for compiling and running RISC-V programs.

Labs:
Wrote and compiled a C program (1ton.c) to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n using GCC (gcc 1ton.c) and executed it (./a.out). Simulated the same program using the RISC-V GCC toolchain (riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc) and Spike simulator (spike pk 1ton.o), verifying identical outputs.

Day 2: Introduction to ABI and Basic Verification Flow Focus: Exploring the Application Binary Interface (ABI) and basic verification processes.

Key Concepts:

ABI: Defines the interface between compiled applications and the operating system, ensuring compatibility between binary modules. It standardizes how compilers and assemblers generate binary code. RISC-V Registers: The RISC-V architecture uses 32 registers, each represented by a 5-bit binary pattern ((2^5 = 32)), as seen in instructions like load doubleword.

Labs:

Implemented a 1-to-9 adder using ABI by creating two files: 1to9_custom.c (C program) and load.S (assembly code for the summation logic). Compiled both files using riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o 1to9_custom.o 1to9_custom.c load.S and simulated with spike pk 1to9_custom.o, confirming correct summation output.



Day 3: Digital Logic with TL-Verilog and Makerchip Focus: Introduction to digital logic, combinational and sequential circuits, and TL-Verilog on the Makerchip platform.

Key Concepts:

Logic Gates: Fundamental gates (AND, OR, NOT) form the basis of digital circuits, enabling the creation of complex gates like NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR. Combinational Circuits: Outputs depend only on current inputs, with no memory of past states. Sequential Circuits: Outputs depend on current inputs and past states, using memory elements like flip-flops. Flip-Flops: Bistable devices that store a single bit, toggled by control signals like clock pulses. Pipelined Logic: Divides tasks into stages for parallel execution, improving throughput. Validity: Optimizes chip design by eliminating idle gates, reducing power consumption.

Labs:

Combinational Calculator: Implemented a TL-Verilog calculator for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in Makerchip. Sequential Calculator: Extended the combinational calculator to include sequential logic. Fibonacci Sequence: Designed a TL-Verilog circuit to generate the Fibonacci sequence, where each value is the sum of the previous two. Pythagorean Theorem Pipeline: Created a pipelined circuit to compute (c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}). Calculator with Validity and Memory: Enhanced the calculator with validity checks and memory operations.

Day 4: Basic RISC-V CPU Microarchitecture Focus: Building the foundational components of a RISC-V CPU microarchitecture.

Key Concepts:

Program Counter (PC) Multiplexer: Selects the next instruction address based on instruction type. Instruction Memory (IMEM) Read: Fetches instructions from memory using the PC address. Decoder: Translates binary instructions into control signals for execution. Register File: Manages 32 registers for read and write operations. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): Performs arithmetic and logical operations.

Labs:

Fetch and Decode: Implemented TL-Verilog code for instruction fetch and decoding, covering instruction types (I, R, S, B, J, U) and immediate value extraction. Half-Completed RISC-V CPU: Built a partial CPU to perform addition


Day 5: Complete Pipelined RISC-V CPU Microarchitecture Focus: Completing a pipelined RISC-V CPU with full functionality.

Key Concepts:

Pipelining: Divides the CPU into stages (fetch, decode, execute, memory, write-back) for parallel instruction processing. Branch and Jump Handling: Manages control flow with instructions like BEQ, BNE, JAL, and JALR. Memory Operations: Supports load and store instructions for data memory access. Verification: Ensures the CPU correctly computes the sum of numbers 1 to 9.

Labs:

Implemented a complete pipelined RISC-V CPU in TL-Verilog, incorporating instruction fetch, decode, register file operations, ALU, branch/jump handling, and memory operations. Verified the CPU by checking if register x10 contains the sum (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45).

Tools and Platforms

Linux Terminal: 
Used for compiling and running C and assembly programs. Spike Simulator: Simulated RISC-V programs to verify functionality. Makerchip IDE: Provided a platform for writing, compiling, and visualizing TL-Verilog code. RISC-V GCC Toolchain: Compiled C and assembly code for the RISC-V architecture.

Outcomes:
The workshop equipped participants with a deep understanding of RISC-V architecture and microprocessor design. Key outcomes include:

Proficiency in writing and simulating C and assembly programs for RISC-V. Practical experience in designing combinational and sequential circuits using TL-Verilog. Successful implementation of a pipelined RISC-V CPU capable of executing arithmetic, logical, branch, jump, and memory operations. Enhanced problem-solving skills through hands-on labs and debugging.
